CRITERION

############################################
            Cluster Trading (Board Consensus)
############################################
- Did multiple insiders buy within a 7-day window? (The "Wolfpack" signal).
- If no cluster, heavily overvalue the CFO and Chief Accounting Officer.
- VETO: If the CFO is buying, but 3 Directors are selling on the same day (Conflicted Board).

############################################
            Relative Position Increase
############################################
- DELETE "Estimated Wealth" (We cannot legally access an executive's wallet).
- USE: "Shares Bought" divided by "Shares Owned Following Transaction".
- Example: If a CEO buys 10k shares, and his total balance becomes 20k, he just increased his position by 50%. Massive conviction signal.

############################################
                Market Cap
############################################
- Compare trade value to Company Market Cap (Log Scale).
- Strongest signal: Small-Cap and Micro-Cap companies (Wall Street analysts ignore them, so the insider has maximum information asymmetry).
- Compare trade value to Average Daily Trading Volume (Is the insider absorbing all the liquidity?).

############################################
        Price Gap (The 2-Day SEC Window)
############################################
- Because of the SEC 2-Day rule, what happened to the price between the Trade Date and the Report Date?
- Include Volatility (ATR). 
- If the price already surged +10% before the SEC form dropped, the alpha is gone.

############################################
              Routine vs Opportunistic
############################################
- Compare to trades of past 3 years.
- Did they buy in this exact same month last year? (Usually bonus season). If so, VETO signal.
- Has the insider been dormant for 2 years and suddenly dropped $500k? STRONG BUY.

############################################
               Types of Trades
############################################
- ONLY evaluate 'Code P' (Open Market Purchases), and do no direclty follow an outside company as a >10% owner, but prefer to use it as a confirmation signal.
- Direct ('D') vs Indirect ('I'). Direct means personal cash. Indirect means family trust/LLC (Weaker signal).
- Track Record: What is the insider's historical win rate on past trades?
